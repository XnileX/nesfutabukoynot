ðŸŽ“ Capstone Project

This repository showcases our Capstone Project titled "Fruits and Vegetables Recognition Application System", developed as part of our academic journey at Sibugay Technical Institute Incorporated.

Through collaboration, determination, and a shared passion for technology, we brought this project to life as a reflection of the skills and knowledge we've gained.  
The application was built using Kotlin, and the machine learning model was developed and trained using TensorFlow Lite in Python, leveraging deep learning techniques.

Specifically, we used a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture based on MobileNet, which is optimized for mobile and embedded vision applications. This allowed us to build an efficient and accurate recognition system for classifying various fruits and vegetables.
